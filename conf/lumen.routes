# Routes
# This file defines all application routes (Higher priority routes first)
# ~~~~

# TODO: routes are set up in the application project because
# they need to refer to the concrete controller class(es).
# Figure out some way to accommodate that elegantly.

# Map static resources from the /public folder to the /assets URL path
GET     /assets/*file        lumen.controllers.Assets.versioned(path="/public/lib/lumen", file)
