# Lumen

A discovery web front-end framework for [Apache Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/).

Lumen is a port of [Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org/) to
[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and the
[Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/). The goal is to
combine Blacklight's great features and architecture with the benefits
of a statically typed, compiled language and functional programming
principles. Like Blacklight, Lumen aims to provide a working
out-of-the-box solution that also offers a high degree of
customizability.

Needless to say, this project owes a great deal (everything, really)
to Blacklight's authors and contributors.

# Status

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/codeforkjeff/lumen/wiki) for current project status, what has been completed, and
what remains to be done.

Please help out if you know Blacklight, Rails, Scala, the Play
framework, Solr, or if you want to learn any of these things and get
your hands dirty hacking code.
